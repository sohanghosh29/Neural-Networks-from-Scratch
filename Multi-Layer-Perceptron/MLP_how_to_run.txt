To execute follow the below steps:

1) Save all the .py and .csv files in one directory.
2) Go to command line and execute: python MLP.py
3) You will be prompted to select which dataset you want to run MLP on: [1] Iris, [2] Handwritten Digits (scikit learn load_digits dataset).
4) Next enter the no of Hidden Layers in the model.
5) Then you will be prompted to enter the number of nodes (excluding the bias) of each hidden layer.
6) Then enter the learning rate, momentum factor and number of epochs to run.
7) The created network architecture and the training progress for each iteration is shown.
8) Finally the Test Accuracy is shown.

Some Suggestions:

>IRIS Dataset:
1) learning rate = 0.01, momentum = 0.9 seems to work well
2) Network with 1 Hidden Layer with 10 nodes seem to work well (about 200 epochs)
3) Network with 2 Hidden Layers with 12 and 8 nodes seem to work well (about 500 epochs)
4) Network with 3 Hidden Layers with 30, 15 and 8 nodes seem to work well (about 1000 epochs)

>Handwritten Digits Dataset:
1) learning rate = 0.1, momentum = 0.9 seems to work well
2) Network with 1 Hidden Layer with 40 nodes seem to work well (about 30 epochs)
3) Network with 2 Hidden Layers with 100 and 32 nodes seem to work well (about 50 epochs)
4) Network with 3 Hidden Layers with 100, 50 and 24 nodes seem to work well (about 300 to 500 epochs)

Note: Ofcourse any other network architectures can be used too. The above are just some verified suggestions.
